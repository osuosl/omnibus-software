# openssl 1.0.0m fixes a security vulnerability:
#   https://www.openssl.org/news/secadv_20140605.txt
# Since the rubyinstaller.org doesn't release ruby when a dependency gets
# patched, we are manually patching the dependency until we get a new
# ruby release on windows.
# This component should be removed when we upgrade to the next version of
# rubyinstaller > 1.9.3-p545 and 2.0.0-p451
